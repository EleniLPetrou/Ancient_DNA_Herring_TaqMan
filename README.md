## Study Summary

In this study, we investigated the relative contributions of genetically and phenologically distinct herring populations to Indigenous Peoplesâ€™ food systems over multiple centuries, using ancient DNA extracted from archaeological herring bones. Using genetic stock identification from seven nuclear DNA markers, we showed that catches at the two sites in central Puget Sound were dominated by January-February and March-April spawners, which are the contemporary spawning groups in the vicinity of the sites.
